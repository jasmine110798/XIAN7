                  Choose one: Changan Chu experience of foodie
                  If you come to Xi'an for the first time, and then a foodie, I suggest that you are in the ancient city, North Street Station of Metro Line 2 to Yongning Gate Station to find a hotel near the subway entrance. There are two reasons:

                  The transportation is convenient. From here, you can go to the airport and high -speed rail station. It is also convenient to go to major attractions. Many can take the subway or walk;
                  Near the clock tower and Huifang concentrated most of the local foods in Xi'an. I will sweep a few nights every night, and then look at the night view of the bell and drum tower, and then walk back to the hotel.
